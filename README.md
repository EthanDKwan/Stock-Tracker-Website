This was a project I conceived and began working on around February 2nd, 2025. The idea was to develop a tool for stock market tracking that would help me put into practice miscellaneous knowledge about trading stocks as well as a platform to learn more about developing software tools. 

Problem statement: the casual stock trader/investor does not continuously monitor stock movement nor incorporate short-term stock price movement (such as due to news, financial reports, patents, etc). Rather, they may buy a market-conglomerate ETF and set-and-forget their money. While this is a proven and effective strategy, there is the yet-unsolved question of whether a trading strategy can be developed to beat the market. Furthermore, as a casual trader, there is the additional hurdle of trying to beat the set-and-forget strategy with minimal attention, knowledge, and time.

Concept: The concept is a semi-automated rule-based trading algorithm to provide trading suggestions that will run continuously in the background and notify the user whenever a potential trading opportunity may exist, based on the pre-defined strategies, suggesting a trading action, and minimizing attention, time, and knowledge requirements while beating the market.
- Note: Obviously, this goal is the challenge of multi-trillion-dollar financial industries and I don't expect to be able to solve this myself, but I do hope to be able to learn something and build something interesting.

Looking forward to the journey on this project
