About the Project
Problem Statement
The casual stock trader/investor often does not continuously monitor stock movements or incorporate short-term price changes (e.g., due to news, financial reports, or patents). Instead, they may buy a market-conglomerate ETF and adopt a "set-and-forget" strategy. While effective, this raises the question: Can a more informed trading strategy be implemented to help while requiring minimal attention, knowledge, and time?

Concept
This project explores a semi-automated, rule-based trading algorithm that:

Runs continuously in the background.

Notifies users of potential trading opportunities based on pre-defined strategies.

Minimizes attention, time, and knowledge requirements while aiming to outperform the market.

Note: This goal is a challenge even for multi-trillion-dollar financial industries. While I donâ€™t expect to solve it entirely, I hope to learn and build something interesting along the way.
